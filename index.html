In Japanese, 遊戯王 (yugiō), which is stylized 遊☆戯☆王, means "king of games".
It is also a pun with the protagonist's name, Yugi, since it means "game" (遊戯). 
The English title uses "Oh!" instead of ō to reflect the cry that Yugi utters when 
transforming into Yami Yugi. Kazuki Takahashi has also stated that the character 
names "Yūgi" and "Jōnouchi" are based on the word yūjō (友情), which means "friendship".

Plot
See also: List of Yu-Gi-Oh! characters
Yu-Gi-Oh! tells the tale of Yugi Mutou, a timid young boy who loves all sorts 
of games,but is often bullied around. One day, he solves an ancient puzzle
 known as the Millennium Puzzle (千年パズル, Sennen Pazuru),causing his body
  to play host to a mysterious spirit withthe personality of a gambler. 
From that moment onwards,whenever Yugi or one of his friends is threatened
 by those with darkness in their hearts, this other Yugi shows himself and 
 challenges them to dangerous Shadow Games (闇のゲーム, Yami no Gēmu, lit. 
"Games of Darkness") which reveal the true nature of someone's heart, 
the losers of these contests often being subjected to a dark punishment called a 
 Penalty Game (罰ゲーム, Batsu Gēmu). Whether it be cards, dice, or
role-playing board games, he will take on challenges from anyone, anywhere. As the serie
 s progresses, Yugi and his friends learn that this person inside of his 
 puzzle is actually the spirit of a nameless Pharaoh from Ancient Egyptian times,
 who had lost his memories. As Yugiand his companions attempt to help the 
 Pharaoh regain his memories, they find themselves

  going through many trials as they wager their lives facing off against gamers that 
  wield the mysterious MillenniumItems (千年アイテム, Sennen Aitemu) and the dark 
  power of the Shadow Games.[4]

Significance of Duel Monsters
The early chapters of Yu-Gi-Oh! feature a variety of different games; but from 
chapter 60 (volume 7) onwards, the most common game that appeared as a 
plot device was the Duel Monsters card game (formerly known as Magic & Wizards) 
through the Duelist Kingdom and Battle City tournament arcs; receiving elevated
plot relevance in the latter arc. Other games still appear during the DDD
 and Memory World portions of the manga and gaming in general is often referred
to; the modern card game being a recent fad in Japanimported from the United 
States within the original story.

However, NAS/Studio Gallop's Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters anime promotes Duel Monsters
as the story's main premise as well as in filler, shifting its universe to a 
more Duel Monsters-centric universe. Duel Monstersis played using a holographic 
image system created by Seto Kaiba (following his first Shadow Game match with 
 Yugi). In the manga and Toei Animation's Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, these were initially 
 performed on tables called Duel Boxes, using holographic tubes, while Yu-Gi-Oh! 
 Duel Monsters uses huge holographic fields calledDuel Rings. Starting with the 
 Battle City arc (in both versions), duels are performed using portable
Duel Disks, invented by Seto Kaiba, president of KaibaCorp, using "solid vision" 
technology, which allows Shadow Game-esque games of Duel Monsters to happen 
anywhere.[citation needed]

Development
In the initial planning stages of the manga, Takahashi had wanted to draw 
a horror manga.[5] Although the end result was a manga about games, it was 
clear that some horror elements influenced certain aspects of the story. 
Takahashi decided to use "battle" as his primary theme. Since there had 
been so much "fighting" manga, he found it difficult to come up with 
something original. He decided to create a fighting manga where the main 
character doesn't hit anybody, but also struggled with that limitation. 
When the word"game" came to mind, he found it much easier to work with.
